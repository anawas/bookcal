# BookCal README

## Principle
Allow potential customers to quickly indentify availabilies for a guest house and preregister the dates they intend to book.
We consider it is a preregistration as, currently, we do not request to pay any no deposit.

## Current features

* Display a booking calendar with a form to send preregistation
